## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

- **1.** First thing i encountered whas how to make a reasonable and professional looking README file
- (solution)got help from readme.so and some minor inputs from Chat gpt to get the syntax right
- **2.** learning about node,react,axios,express,MySQL and how to use api's all in a short period of time,
  (used Linkedin Learning, some youtube, friends and some questions was sent to chat gpt to get a deeper understanding about certain concepts
  this whole learning period lasted two weeks before i could start writing code in this project)
- **3.** ran an npm update latest, got a mesage about vulnerabilities, spent some time figuring out what that meant and how to deal with it.
  (learned that not all issues with vulnerabilities are important to solve)
- **4.** started to set up server, realized i need to create a database, tried making it with MySQL, didn't understand and got stuck in tutorial hell for about 5 days,
  (im now a "master" of MySQL, back to server work)
- **5.** i intended to use the insight api from Nasa, turns out the api would give little to no data.
  ( i decided to pivot and go for an airquality api called OpenAQ,)
- **6.** 
- **7.**
