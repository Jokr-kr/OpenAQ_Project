(insight) pressure returned in pascal
bar = pascal * 10**-5 || pascal / 10**5 ('**'operator for exponentiation) ||
psi = pascal * 0.000145038 || pascal / 6894.76 

(insight) Temperature returned in ℃
to get ℉:
℉ = (celsius * 9/5) + 32         
alternatively since 9/5 == 1.8
℉ = (celsius * 1.8) + 32
